## Getting Running Locally

You'll need ruby for the site to run locally. Follow the instructions here for downloading ruby and other dependencies required: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/. This guide will install Ruby, Bundler and Jekyll and put the gems in your path

Check you have Ruby version 2.3.3

If you haven't already, in a terminal, type:

 `$ gem install jekyll bundler`

Then you should be up and running! To run the site locally, type:

`$ bundle exec jekyll serve`.

Head over to your broswer and go to http://localhost:4000/ to view the site!

Well done, you're up and running!
