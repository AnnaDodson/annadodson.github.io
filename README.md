# Hacktobesfest Website

This website is a community website for everyone to be able to contribute to. Tech should be accessible to everyone and everyone should be included in the making of it. This site aims to help break down barriers and allow people to contribute to a project with whatever skills they have.

## How to contribute

You can contribute through the browser or from your favourite terminal. Go the [contributing guide](/contributing.md) to learn how.

## Getting The Site Running Locally

You'll need ruby for the site to run locally. Follow the instructions [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) for downloading ruby and the other dependencies you'll need.

Check you have Ruby version 2.3.3

If you haven't already, in a terminal, type:

 `$ gem install jekyll bundler`

Then you should be up and running! To run the site locally, make sure you're in the project folder root and run:

`$ bundle exec jekyll serve`.

Head over to your browser and go to [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/) to view the site!

Well done, you're up and running!
