# Hello World
- I am not new to pull requests but this is my first time contributing to an open source website, which btw is really cool. I believe that really cool things could be done with open source websites, as each section of the website will be entirely different from the others, reflecting their style and personalities.

I hope I can see more projects like this in the future.

Really liked #TechNottingham today btw

Ciao
