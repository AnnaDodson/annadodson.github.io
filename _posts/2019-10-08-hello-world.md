obligatory "hello world!"...

...I have literally no idea what I'm doing. But Anna is next to me and is an excellent teacher. I'm at nottsjs; it's Tuesday and starting to go dark very early now.
I am learning lots about GitHub, markdown and hacktoberfest, which is great! 
Macs are pretty different to use for me, but adds to the 'learning new things' I'm doing right now- thank you Carol for letting me use your very pretty laptop!

This will be first first ever pull request and I'm very excited :D ...And will get sweets very soon, which is all the better! Yay!

Over and out.

Mica :grin:
