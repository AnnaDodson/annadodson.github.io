# This is my (awesome ?) post - I'm a bit nervous...
Yesterday I attended the IoT meetup at UNiDAYS.  
When I finally found the front door and was buzzed in, 
I climbed what felt like a million steps up to the meeting room.  
Puffed out I was warmly welcomed by Peter Gallagher at the top.
He was so nice and reassuring that I forgot I was a newbie and completely unfit!
I quickly looked around and saw the lovely Anna who welcomed me, 
in between trying to get ready for her talk.  A big thank you.
I settled down with a drink on a comfy office chair and 
really enjoyed the speed talks presented by a variety of amazing speakers.
As an outsider (not working in IT at the moment) I got to say the talks 
were all so interesting and diverse. Half way through the evening we all 
had a really tasty curry (just like I make at home) and we discussed some of the talks.
The evening was rounded off by a talk by Steven Pears about Alexa and IoT Gadgets. 
It was a very moving talk (nearly had to use a tissue).
All the talks were amazing and I am so glad I went.
