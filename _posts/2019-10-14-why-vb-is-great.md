# VB is Great... Honestly!
I really like vb.net, mainly because it's stemmed off my first programming language on the Sinclair Spectrum!

The main thing I like is the lack of semicolons and curly braces!

I've come all the way through from the good old rubber keyed ZX Speccy, through VB6 and then the first version of vb.net back in 2003.

To be fair, it's now basically a sister language of C#, and a first class citizen in the Microsoft World.
